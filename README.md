# MATH 201 (Linear Algebra & Victor Geometry) Course Project

This project is composed of an application that finds a parametrization for the production level vector of an economic entity with several industries having some input-output matrix and a given demand vector based on the Leontief input-output model.

## Leontief Input-Output Model
This model is based on dividing a given country into several industries, each of which has two types of demands: external demand (from outside the system of the country) and internal demand (from another industry in the system of the country itself). This model was proposed by Professor Wassily Leontief, after which he won the Nobel prize for the great implications on economy his mathematical invention has been having.
